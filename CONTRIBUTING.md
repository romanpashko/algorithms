# Contributing

We love pull requests from everyone. By contributing to this repository, you
agree to abide by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Get Started
First [fork][fork] the repository and then clone it using:

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/algorithms.git


You may contribute by:
- implementing new algorithms in the repo. Be sure to keep it under
right section (e.g. [array](array), [dp](dp), etc). Make a new section for it if
it doesn't fall under any section.
- optimizing or improving the existing algorithms.
- adding a different solution for the problem.
- finding and fixing bugs.
- adding examples to explain the algorithms better.
- adding test cases.

## Pull Requests
Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].

We will review and may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.
Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* All algorithms should be written in **Python 3**. 
(There are a few algorithms still in _Python 2_ syntax. You can start by converting
[those][issue120] to _Python 3_.)
* Write clean and understandable code.
* Properly comment the code and briefly explain what the algorithm is doing in the [docstrings][docstr].
* You may also explain the output using a minimal example.
* Try to also include a couple of test cases for the algorithm.
* Write a [good commit message][commit].


## Issues
Whenever you want a new algorithm to be added, or find some bugs in the existing algorithms, 
just [submit an issue][newissue] and feel free to discuss over it.
Or you may resolve any of the [existing issues][issues].
